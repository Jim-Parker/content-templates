# Article title
<!--
- This template is specific to Cloud Design Patterns.
- Your article:
  - Can only have one H1 heading (#), which is the article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a short descriptive paragraph that describes what the article is about and how it can help the reader.
  - Should describe the problem that the pattern addresses, identify considerations for applying the pattern, and provide an example based on Microsoft Azure. Most of the patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure.
  - Be broken down into six subheadings. These are are Context and problem, Solution, Issues and considerations, When to use this pattern, Workload design, Example, and Next steps. The H2 headings (##) and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###).
  - Shouldn't start with an alert.
-->

<!--**Completing the metadata:**_
_This section provides guidance on how to complete the metadata section at the top of this template. Update the placeholder text based on the following guidance:

- **title:** Use the H1 (#) title of your article from the top of this section. Both titles should be identical. Maximum recommended length is 60 characters.
- **description:** Provide a brief summary of your article. This is the description that appears in search engine results, so ensure that the summary is clear and concise and attracts your intended audience. Recommended character count is 150-160 characters.
- **keywords:** Add a comma-separated list of key concepts and terms from your article. These are the words that your intended audience will submit in a search engine.
- **ms.date:** Enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, as shown in the metadata field. Initially, this should be the date your article is published. After publication, this field should be refreshed whenever the article is updated so that readers can see that the content is fresh.
- **pnp.series.title:** Cloud Design Patterns is always the correct patterns and practices series title for this template. Don't change it.
- **pnp.pattern.categories:** Review the following bracketed list and delete all categories that don't apply to your article: [availability, data-management, design-implementation, messaging, management-monitoring, performance-scalability, resiliency, security]. Copy and paste the final bracketed list into the metadata section.

## Context and problem
<!--Provide a brief background on the specific pattern and the problem that the pattern addresses.-->

## Solution
<!--Describe the solution for the problem described in the **Context and problem** section. If there are multiple solutions, list them in order of complexity and provide instructions on how the reader can choose the best solution for their given problem. Best practices are to provide a step-by-step approach to implement the solution, and to include screenshots to help guide the reader.-->

## Issues and considerations
<!--Highlight pertinent concerns relevant to implementing the solution provided in the previous section. Best practices are to start this section with the following boilerplate sentence, followed by a bulleted list of topics for the reader to contemplate prior to implementing the given solution.-->

Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## When to use this pattern

<!--Describe in detail when and when not to use this pattern. Use the following boilerplate text to help the reader determine if the solution is applicable to their specific scenario.-->

Use this pattern when:

## Workload design

An architect should evaluate how the <!--insert name of pattern here--> can be used in their workload's design to address the goals and principles covered in the [Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars](/azure/well-architected/pillars). For example:

<!--Include only the rows that are relevant. This list should be a pivot of the data on the design patterns lists in the Azure Well-Architected Framework, so the two lists should maintain parity. Don't add something here that isn't also in WAF's lists. The italicized content in the table should be updated as needed.-->

| Pillar | How this pattern supports pillar goals |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| [Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist) design decisions help your workload become **resilient** to malfunction and ensures that it **recovers** to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs. | _Explain how this pattern supports the stated goal of the pillar.

Consider any tradeoffs against the goals of the other pillars that this pattern might introduce.

## Example
<!--Include a working sample that shows the reader how the pattern solution is used in a real-world situation. The sample should be specific and provide code snippets when appropriate.-->
