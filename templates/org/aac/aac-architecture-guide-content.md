# H1 title
<!--
- Follow the instructions in the following H2 (##) headings and adhere to all Microsoft and Learn style and pull request criteria. Architecture Guides don't have any other content requirements.
- Diagrams aren't required for this content type, but if a diagram is included, include a subsequent **Dataflow** or **Workflow** section to explain it. For more information, see the [Example workload template](sample-solution-templates). 
- The Architecture Guide template requires the following sections at the end of the article.

## Contributors
<!--This section is expected but optional if all the contributors prefer not to include it.

1. Start with the explanation text in italics that's the same for every article. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article and not a single contributor.

1. Include the list of "Principal authors" and the list of "Additional contributors," if there are any. Format in plain text, not italics or bold.

1. Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. 

1. Insert a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces after the name, and then enter the person's title. To minimize edits or updates, don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles. You can link to any additional profiles from the person's LinkedIn page.

## Next steps
<!--
- Add a bulleted list of links to third-party and other Learn and Microsoft topics. These topics can include links to pages that provide additional context or that might be useful in a next-steps context.
- Format Learn links to be site relative, such as (/azure/feature/article-name).
- Don't include locales such as `en-us` in links unless they don't work without it.
- Don't include a trailing slash in any links.

## Related resources
<!--
- Add a bulleted list of related resource links.
- Use this section for architecture information that's relevant to the current article. It must be content that the Azure Architecture Center TOC refers to but can be from a repo other than the AAC repo.
- Ensure that links to articles in the AAC repo are repo-relative, such as (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
