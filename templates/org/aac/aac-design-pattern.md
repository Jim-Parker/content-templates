## Workload design

Evaluate how to use <!--insert name of pattern--> in a workload's design to address the goals and principles covered in the [Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars](/azure/well-architected/pillars). The following table provides guidance about how this pattern supports the goals of each pillar.

<!--
- In the following table, include only the relevant rows. 
- Don't add information that's not part of the Well-Architected Framework pillars. 
- Replace or remove the table's italicized content.

## Example

<!-- Include a working sample that shows a real-world application. -->

## Next steps

The following information might be relevant when you implement this pattern:

<!--
- Add a bulleted list of links to third-party or Microsoft topics that can help customers build the workload.
- Link formats: 
  - Make Learn links site relative (for example, /azure/<feature>/<article-name>).
  - Start third-party links with `https://` and omit `en-us` unless the links don't work without it.
  - Omit a trailing slash.
-->
