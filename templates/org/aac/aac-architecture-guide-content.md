<!--
- Follow the instructions in the following H2 (##) headings and adhere to all Microsoft and Learn style and pull request criteria. Architecture Guides don't have any other content requirements.
- Diagrams aren't required for this content type, but if a diagram is included, include a subsequent **Dataflow** or **Workflow** section to explain it. For more information, see the [Example workload template](sample-solution-templates). 
- The Architecture Guide template requires the following sections at the end of the article.

## Contributors
<!--This section is expected but optional if all the contributors prefer not to include it.

1. Start with the explanation text in italics that's the same for every article. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article and not a single contributor.

1. Include the list of "Principal authors" and the list of "Additional contributors," if there are any. Format in plain text, not italics or bold.

1. Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. 

1. Insert a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces after the name, and then enter the person's title. To minimize edits or updates, don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles. You can link to any additional profiles from the person's LinkedIn page.

## Next steps

> Link to Learn articles. Could also be to appropriate sources outside of Learn, such as GitHub repos, third-party documentation, or an official technical blog post. 
> - Links shouldn't include en-us locale unless they don't work without it.
> - Learn links should be site-relative, for example (/azure/feature/article-name).
> - Don't include trailing slash in any links.
> Example:

- [Azure Machine Learning documentation](/azure/machine-learning)
- [What are Azure AI Services?](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services)

## Related resources

> Use "Related resources" for architecture information that's relevant to the current article. It must be content that the Azure Architecture Center TOC refers to, but may be from a repo other than the AAC repo.
> Links to articles in the AAC repo should be repo-relative, for example (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
> Here is an example section:
