<!--Add a bulleted-list of items that describe when this pattern is a good choice.-->

This pattern might not be suitable when:

<!--Add a bulleted-list of items that describe when this pattern isn't a good choice.-->

## Workload design

An architect should evaluate how they can use <!--insert name of pattern here--> in their workload's design to address the goals and principles covered in the [Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars](/azure/well-architected/pillars). The following table provides guidance about how this pattern supports the goals of each pillar.

<!--
- In the following table, include only the relevant rows. 
- Don't add information that's not part of the Well-Architected Framework pillars. 
- Replace or remove the table's italicized content.
-->

| Pillar | How this pattern supports pillar goals |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| [Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist) design decisions help your workload become **resilient** to malfunction and ensure that it **recovers** to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs. | _Explain how this pattern supports the stated goal of the pillar.

Consider any tradeoffs against the goals of the other pillars that this pattern might introduce.

## Example

<!--
- Include a working sample that shows a real-world application. 
- The sample should be specific and provide code snippets when appropriate.
-->

## Next steps

The following information might be relevant when you implement this pattern:

<!--
- Add a bulleted list of links to third-party or Microsoft topics that can help customers build the workload.
- Link formats: 
  - Make Learn links site relative (for example, /azure/<feature>/<article-name>).
  - Start third-party links with `https://` and omit `en-us` unless the links don't work without it.
  - Omit a trailing slash.

Example list:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) documentation](/azure/aks)
- [Azure Machine Learning documentation](/azure/machine-learning)
- [What is Azure Active Directory B2C?](/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview)
- [Application Insights overview](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
-->
